# BEANIGHT

    LORE
    Beanight is a game where you play as a bean named Bobeans. His 
lifegoal is to grow as a beautiful and strong bean plant, for the sake of his
kind.
 
    He's very frustrated because he lives in a very rocky and dark
environment, so he can't find fertile ground to grow in. Luckily for
him, he's the descendant of the light god, Beanight. 

    He received at birth the power to shine through the shadows, 
thanks to his luminous heart. This blessing helps him navigate 
through his hostile environment, by throwing parts of his body to 
enlighten his way.
